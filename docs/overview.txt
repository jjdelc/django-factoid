        The Factoid models has a 'get_random' manager that takes a factoid type's
        name
            >>> Factoid.objects.get_random('greetings')
            <Factoid: [Greetings] Hola ...>

    Templatetags
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    To load the factoids in your templates add
        {% load factoids %}

    And you van use the 'get_factoid' tempaltetag in either of these ways:
        {% get_factoid 'greetings' %}
        Will print in your template a random factoid classified as a greeting

        {% get_factoid 'greetings' as my_factoid %}
        Will add the factoid's text on 'myfactoid' context variable for future use
        on your template

and thats it
